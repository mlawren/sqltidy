DEVELOPER NOTES:

This tool takes SQL and reformats it in an aesthetically pleasing way.
It doesn't follow any standard formatting convention, nor is it even
that consistent with itself (lots of special cases), but it makes SQL
much more bearable to look at.

The script tries to leave the original code alone as much as possible.
It doesn't make any obnoxious capitalization changes or add in any new
keywords.

The best implementation of this tool will be able to parse SQL as well
as an interpreter, and know all about all the keywords and functions.
This script is nothing like that.  It's just a quick hackjob that does
basic tokenization and tries to fail gracefully when it's not smart
enough.
