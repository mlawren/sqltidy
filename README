NAME
    sqltidy - format and indent SQL text

SYNOPSIS
        sqltidy FILE [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
    The sqltidy tool reformat SQL in an aesthetically pleasing way. It
    can be run stand-alone (passing a file as an argument) or can be run
    in-place on code in your text editor.

    If "FILE" is passed as an argument to the script, the script will
    non-destructively create a new, tidied version of the file, with the
    extension .tdy appended to the original filename.

    If a filename is not passed, then the script will read from STDIN
    and output the tidied SQL to STDOUT. This makes it suitable for
    in-place edits in your favorite text editor.

OPTIONS
    --help
        Print a help message and exit.

EXIT VALUE
    This command exists with a value of 0 on success.
